                    <p>In 2023, I realized a personal project consisting of the creation of a checkers game in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical interface. This project aimed to develop a functional game with an intuitive interface, allowing two players to compete on a board of 64 boxes, respecting the official rules of the checkers game. Working alone on this project, I had to organize my work independently, planning the different stages of development: design of game logic, implementation of rules, management of moves and captures, as well as the dynamic display of the board.</p>

                    <p>This project allowed me to acquire and strengthen several skills, in particular in object-oriented programming, event management with Tkinter and modular code structuring. I also honed my ability to solve logical problems and optimize code to ensure smooth, error-free operation. Working alone, I have developed methodological rigor and increased autonomy in managing a computer project.</p>

                <article class="gauche">
                    <p>I also created a ZIP file containing the game as an executable (.exe), which allows it to run easily without having to install Python or Tkinter. You can download the file below to test the game directly on your computer.</p>
